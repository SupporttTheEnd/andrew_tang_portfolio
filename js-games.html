                <h3>City Defender</h3>
                <p>This game, "City Defender," was developed as a personal project over the summer of 2020. It represents one of my earlier JavaScript projects before I transitioned to C++ for game development. The game involves defending a city from various alien threats and requires strategic shooting and movement.</p>
